### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the co-founder and CEO of [Teller](https://teller.io). We make awesome banking APIs that enable you to easily connect your app with user bank accounts. To do this we reverse engineer native mobile banking apps, build our own tooling (sometimes in handcoded assembly language), and build bullet-proof production services in [Elixir Lang](https://elixir-lang.org). We sometimes do other crazy stuff like [build our own distributed 4G LTE proxy network](https://blog.teller.io/2020/06/23/improving-api-performance-with-telnet.html) using Raspberry Pi's and [Nerves](http://nerves-project.org). Basically whatever it takes to deliver an awesome product and experience to our users. Want to work with us? [We are hiring!](https://jobs.lever.co/teller)
